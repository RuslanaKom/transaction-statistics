Implementation notes:

1) Application runs on port 8092.

2) Transactions storage is implemented basing on assumption that timestamp is not a unique transaction identifier
    and thus two transactions with same timestamp can exist.

3) From the task description it was assumed that the transaction expiration should be calculated basing on it's timestamp received in in request body,
    so the primary cache implementation is a TimestampBasedCache.
    Though it is also a possible case that the transaction expiration should be evaluated based on a time it was written into cache,
    so alternative implementation is also provided in WriteTimeBasedCache.

4) Some parameters like transaction expiration time limit and bigdecimal scale used were made configurable, so if needed can be supplied as environment variables.
